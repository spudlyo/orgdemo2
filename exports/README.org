* Sample Exports

In this directory you'll find exported text files of both the Debian
and RedHat versions of the document. They were exported from the
[[https://gitlab.com/spudlyo/orgdemo2/-/raw/main/buildemacs.org?ref_type=heads][buildemacs.org]] file using the =org-ascii-publish-to-utf8= function.

I have not committed any samples of the exported PDF files to the
repository, but I have provided external links to them below.
